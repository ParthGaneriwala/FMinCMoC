# FMinCMoC

**Formal Verification in the Common Model of Cognition (CMoC)**

## 🧠 Overview

FMinCMoC is a research initiative focused on integrating formal verification techniques into cognitive modeling. By translating cognitive models from architectures like ACT-R and Soar into formal representations compatible with model checkers such as nuXmv, this project facilitates rigorous analysis and verification of cognitive behavior.

## 🔧 Features

- **ACT-R and Soar Models**: Cognitive models that simulate procedural and declarative knowledge representations.
- **Translation to nuXmv**: Automated or assisted transformation of models into nuXmv syntax for formal property checking.
- **Formal Verification**: Enables model checking of cognitive systems using symbolic tools like nuXmv to verify liveness, safety, and temporal properties.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ParthGaneriwala/FMinCMoC.git

2. Explore Cognitive Models:

Navigate to the ACTR/ or Soar/ folders for original models.

3. Translate Models:

Use provided prompt templates or code to translate cognitive models to nuXmv/.

4. Verify with nuXmv:

Run nuXmv on translated files to verify desired specifications.
