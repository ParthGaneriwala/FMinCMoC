FMinCMoC
Formal Verification in the Common Model of Cognition (CMoC)

🧠 Overview
FMinCMoC is a research initiative aimed at integrating formal verification techniques into cognitive modeling. By translating cognitive models from architectures like ACT-R and Soar into formal representations compatible with model checkers such as nuXmv, this project facilitates rigorous analysis and verification of cognitive models.

🔧 Features
ACT-R and Soar Models: Contains cognitive models developed in ACT-R and Soar architectures.

Translation to nuXmv: Provides translated versions of cognitive models into the nuXmv format for formal verification.

Formal Verification: Enables the use of model checking tools to verify properties of cognitive models, ensuring their correctness and reliability.

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the Repository:
